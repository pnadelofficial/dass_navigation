My actual<br>productivity in my work is<br>actually higher now, and I<br>have been able to carve out<br>time to take long walks as<br>exercise in the morning. This<br>is something I didn't have<br>time to do previously. So,<br>these are all positive impacts<br>on my life, and I am grateful<br>for them.  On the negative<br>side, I worry about my family<br>or friends becoming seriously<br>ill. I am also deeply<br>concerned about the impact on<br>businesses and on the overall<br>economy. I have see our<br>retirement savings and college<br>savings for our kids take a<br>hit because of the stock<br>market. I know that long-term<br>recovery will happen, but it's<br>still worrisome.  This<br>situation has also stoked a<br>lot of political anger for me.<br>I already despised Donald<br>Trump before COVID.

Many people at<br>my employer have lost their<br>job or been furloughed, which<br>has significantly increased my<br>worries. I'm actually making<br>more money than ever before (I<br>work on Mturk/Prolific when<br>I'm ""working from home"" and my<br>husband has been given a pay<br>increase over his usual work<br>due to being an essential<br>worker) but this doesn't ease<br>my concerns about unemployment<br>and/or economic downturn. The<br>federal government and my<br>state government (OR) is not<br>doing as good of jobs as they<br>can be doing. Along with this<br>stress, the protests are just<br>fucking stupid. It's an<br>important topic, but my god!<br>Wait until the pandemic is<br>over. You can be ""dead right""<br>and that's what these people<br>will essentially be if they<br>keep up all this nonsense<br>while we're supposed to be<br>social distancing. I'm tired<br>of going anywhere (groceries,<br>work, restaurants, anywhere)<br>and seeing jackasses not<br>wearing masks and fighting<br>actively against it. Just like<br>you need to work to pay your<br>bills, just wear a damn mask.<br>Don't put anyone else at risk.<br>I hate it too, but I'm not a<br>baby and don't complain about<br>the rules. I'm glad my husband<br>and I have spent so much<br>quality time together, but at<br>times the constant company is<br>grating when we're home<br>together for extended periods.<br>Lacking exercise has got me<br>feeling more fat and more<br>negative about my mortality<br>(dying early due to<br>weight/diabetes/heart attack)<br>and it's stressful too.",24

The<br>airline didn't alert us, we<br>only found out because I had<br>been checking the flight<br>status almost hourly. We<br>decided to book an earlier<br>flight and rushed to get<br>everything ready.   We flew<br>back to the US on the last<br>British Airways flight before<br>the travel restrictions<br>tightened.

I had to market my<br>services differently, and had<br>more clients that I have had<br>in the past 3 years of running<br>the business because so many<br>people adopted puppies; we<br>call them pandemic puppies in<br>the training world. I was able<br>to really hone my puppy<br>training skills, raise my<br>prices based on demand, and<br>use my time more wisely to<br>create content and build out<br>parts of my business that I<br>didnt have time for before<br>when I was driving to meet<br>clients all day.   I truly<br>grew leaps and bounds this<br>year, in part because I got to<br>listen to myself and what it<br>feels like to say ""no"" as a<br>full sentence. I was able to<br>grow my business, after months<br>of adapting, and grow as a dog<br>trainer. I was able to<br>recharge more in solitude, and<br>spend my energy/time with<br>people that lit me up, rather<br>than doing things out of<br>obligation.   I feel stronger<br>in myself than I did last<br>year. I feel stressed about<br>what is to come, but I know<br>that if I handled staying<br>alive and keeping a business<br>alive during a pandemic that I<br>can handle most anything that<br>comes my way.

My wife<br>isn't typically the type of<br>person to placate me, so I<br>believe her.  We wound up<br>moving, and life seemed to<br>somewhat normalize after two<br>years of living with my<br>parents. I guess as normal as<br>it can be during covid-19.<br>Though a couple days ago my<br>wife said to me that I sleep<br>later now that I live here. I<br>couldn't figure out why<br>initially. I wound up blaming<br>my mother on it. I said she<br>never got up early, so I got<br>up earlier to enjoy the peace<br>of the day. It wasn't until I<br>was filling out this<br>questionnaire that I realized<br>I sleep in so much later now<br>because I don't go into<br>college anymore.   I use to go<br>into college every day, and<br>now that I don't I basically<br>have not motivation to get up.<br>It's sad to realize how the<br>isolation has started to<br>effect my life. I miss going<br>in. I spent a lot of time<br>tutoring people in programming<br>(that's what I am going to<br>college for). Not because I<br>got paid for it or anything,<br>but because I enjoyed doing it<br>and people always had<br>questions for me, and I was<br>basically always in the lab...<br>But now that I don't go in I<br>don't get that social<br>interaction anymore.   I've<br>also noticed that my grades<br>are starting to slip because I<br>don't go into the labs every<br>day.
